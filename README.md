This project is written in Typescript, using React for the UI library, and Tailwindcss for styling. UI components from [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) are integrated throughout the web app. The web app employs OAuth2 OIDC authentication, Tanstack Router for routing, and Tanstack Query for server-state management.
